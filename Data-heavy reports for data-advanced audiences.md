## Data-heavy reports for data-advanced audiences

Remember to leverage the technical expertise of your audience by providing rich, detailed information and advanced analytical tools. While the report should be comprehensive, ensure that it's still well-organized and navigable, allowing users to efficiently access the specific data and insights they need.

### Audience characteristics
In this scenario, data-heavy reports are typically designed for:
- Data scientists and analysts
- Senior developers and technical architects
- Research and development teams
- Technical decision-makers and executives with strong data backgrounds

This audience generally has:
- Advanced knowledge of statistics and data analysis
- Experience interpreting complex data visualizations and models
- A need for in-depth, detailed insights to drive decision-making
- Ability to handle and desire for granular, comprehensive data presentations
- An expectation to see the methodology used during research

### General guidelines
1. Prioritize depth and comprehensiveness of information over simplification
2. Don't be afraid to show a lot of data
3. Use advanced visualization techniques that convey complex relationships at no cost to the message
4. Include detailed statistical analyses and model explanations
5. Provide access to raw data or data extraction capabilities
6. Include technical appendices with methodologies and data processing details

### Example approach

For a software house's data-heavy report on documentation system performance:

1. **What to show:**
   - Advanced statistical models like multivariate regression analyses of factors affecting documentation quality
   - Network graphs showing relationships between different documentation components
   - Large charts presenting a lot of data, including subgroups
   - Bayesian inference results with posterior distribution plots
   - Detailed performance metrics with statistical significance tests

2. **What not to show:**
   - Oversimplified visualizations that obscure important nuances in the data
   - Basic descriptive statistics without following up with deeper analysis
   - Charts lacking descriptors like error bars or significant differences - when needed
   - Aggregate data without the option to drill down into more granular levels
   - Conclusions without supporting data or methodologies

3. **Technologies to use:**
   - Plotly for advanced interactive visualizations
   - Seaborn to make large visualizations readable and accessible
   - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
   - SciPy and StatsModels for statistical modeling

4. **Explanations:**
   - Provide detailed methodological explanations, including assumptions and limitations
   - Include statistical notation wherever needed
   - Include a glossary of advanced terms and concepts used in the report
