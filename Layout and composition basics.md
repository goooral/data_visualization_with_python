The impact of your visualization doesn't stop at the chart - the layout and composition of your data visualization are crucial for effectively communicating your message. A well-designed layout guides the viewer's eye, emphasizes important information, and creates a harmonious overall presentation.

## Key principles of layout and composition

### 1. Visual hierarchy

Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide viewers through your visualization.

- Use size, color, and position to emphasize important elements
- Place the most critical information where the eye naturally goes first (usually top-left for Western audiences)
- Use white space to create breathing room and focus attention

### 2. Balance

Create a sense of stability and order in your visualization.

- Distribute visual elements evenly across the layout
- Use asymmetrical balance for more dynamic compositions
- Ensure that no single part of the visualization overpowers the others - unless it is supposed to
- Don't cramp up the space, clarity = readability

### 3. Logical flow

Structure your presentation or report to tell a clear, logical story.

- Organize content from general to specific
- Use headings and subheadings to create a clear hierarchy
- Ensure each section leads naturally to the next
- Summarize, remind and simplify in order to aid your audience in remembering the insights

### 4. Consistency

Maintain consistency in design elements throughout your visualization.

- Use consistent colors, fonts, and styles
- Keep sizing and spacing uniform for similar elements
- Establish and follow a clear visual style guide
