# The PowerPoint problem: common issues

## Limited data integration
PowerPoint does not support live data connections. Charts and tables **rely on static Excel data**. Any data updates require manual intervention, increasing the risk of outdated or incorrect information in reports.

> **Example:** *A team discovers an error in their dataset and receives a corrected version. Every affected chart must be manually updatedâ€”one by one.* 

## Manual updates nightmare
Each PowerPoint chart is independent. Any change to scale, content, or formatting must be applied manually to every chart.

## File size issues  
PowerPoint charts can become bloated, especially when pasting data with styles. These issues are difficult to detect and fix, often requiring manual intervention.  

## Inconsistent styling
Unlike coding tools that allow for centralized styling, PowerPoint requires manual formatting, making consistency difficult to maintain across slides.

### Common issues  
- Inconsistent scales reduce **readability**.  
- Mismatched color schemes cause **visual confusion**.  
- Manual placement leads to chart **misalignment**.
- Pie charts allow totals below or exceeding 100% which is **an error**.
- Horizontal bar charts reverse data order by default resulting in **inconvenience**.
- Data labels wrap automatically, as if they were designed for text and **not numerical data**.

## Difficult to maintain accuracy
PowerPoint combines manual adjustments with various automatic formatting behaviors, leading to a wide range of potential errors.
