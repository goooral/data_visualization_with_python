# The PowerPoint Problem: Common Issues

## Limited data integration
PowerPoint does not support live data connections. Charts and tables rely on static Excel data. Any data updates require manual intervention, increasing the risk of outdated or incorrect information in reports.

> *Example:* A team discovers an error in their dataset and receives a corrected version. Every affected chart must be manually updated—one by one. 

## Manual updates nightmare
Each PowerPoint chart is independent. Any change to scale, content, or formatting must be applied manually to every chart.

### Workflow comparison
| Feature            | PowerPoint | Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly) |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Auto-updating charts | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes (live data connection)   |
| Data accuracy    | ❌ Error-prone | ✅ Reliable                   |
| Efficiency        | ❌ Slow       | ✅ Automated                  |

## File Size Issues  
PowerPoint charts can become bloated, especially when pasting data with styles. These issues are difficult to detect and fix, often requiring manual intervention.  

> **Tip:** PowerPoint stores charts as archives. Changing the file extension to `.zip` allows access to embedded Excel data and metadata, but editing these files directly is limited.

## Inconsistent styling
Unlike coding tools that allow for centralized styling, PowerPoint requires manual formatting, making consistency difficult to maintain across slides.

### Common Issues  
- Inconsistent scales reduce readability.  
- Mismatched color schemes cause visual confusion.  
- Manual placement leads to chart misalignment.

## Difficult to maintain accuracy
PowerPoint combines manual adjustments with various automatic formatting behaviors, leading to a wide range of potential errors.

### Frequent issues
- Pie charts allow totals exceeding 100% but display errors below 100%.
- Horizontal bar charts reverse data order by default and reset settings when reopened.
- Data labels wrap automatically, distorting numerical data, and cannot be globally disabled.
