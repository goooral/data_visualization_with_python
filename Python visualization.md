# Python visualization: an overview

## Why Python for visualization?

1. **Versatility**: From simple line graphs to complex interactive dashboards
2. **Integration**: Seamlessly fits into data analysis workflows
3. **Ecosystem**: Rich and diverse, catering to various needs and preferences
4. **Accessibility**: Suitable for beginners and experts alike

## The visualization process overview

Data Preparation → Plot Selection → Customization → Display/Save
This streamlined process allows for quick iteration and experimentation with your data.

## Getting started

### Python basics

While the availability of LLMs allows for much less experience in coding in order to begin working on visualization, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of Python's syntax.

You might want to take a look at the free, yet extensive course offered by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/),
or reach for more specialized courses available on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

### Notebooks

Once you familiarize yourself with the syntax, you can begin working on your first visualizations. In order to set up your workspace, you need a python notebook. 

#### Jupyter

In most cases you will reach for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). 

Jupyter is an open-source project that provides a web-based interactive computing environment that supports multiple programming languages.

Jupyter notebooks are particularly popular in data science, scientific computing, and education. They allow users to:

- Experiment with code in bite-sized chunks
- Visualize data on the fly
- Share complete analyses, including code, results, and explanations

#### Google Colab

As a beginner, in order to learn and train you might want to pick [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based platform based on Jupyter notebooks available your browser. Each time you set up a Google Colab environment, it is in fact a virtual machine hosted on Google infrastructure. This allows you to work on powerful hardware and utilize all possibilities offered by Jupyter notebooks without the lengthy set-up of a local environment.

Colab seamlessly integrates with other Google services, allowing you to:

- Import data from Google Drive
- Save your work directly to the cloud
- Access a wide range of pre-installed libraries
