## In-person presentations

You can utilize data visualizations and report files altogether when preparing a presentation. You will, however, need to adapt the visualizations to make them larger, with more contrasting colours - all which makes a slide more visible on a large screen in a room. 

### Audience characteristics
In this scenario, presentations are typically designed for:
- Mixed groups of technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Clients or potential clients
- Executive teams and decision-makers
- Cross-functional teams including developers, designers, and project managers

This audience generally has:
- Varied levels of technical knowledge and data literacy
- Limited time and attention span during the presentation
- A need for clear, actionable insights presented in an engaging manner
- Expectation for real-time explanations and the ability to ask questions
- Preference for visual representations over raw data

### General guidelines
1. Keep visualizations simple and impactful
2. Use a consistent design theme aligned with your brand
3. Limit the amount of information on each slide or visual
4. Incorporate storytelling techniques to maintain engagement
5. Prepare for interactivity and questions from the audience
6. Ensure visualizations are legible from a distance
7. Prepare for breaks amid your presentation

### Example approach

For a software house's in-person presentation on documentation system performance:

1. **What to show:**
   - Clear, high-contrast bar charts for comparing key metrics
   - Simple line graphs showing trends with annotated key points
   - Infographics that combine icons, numbers, and brief text
   - Before-and-after comparisons using side-by-side visuals
   - Animated builds of charts to guide the audience through data
   - Single, impactful statistics or KPIs with large, bold typography
   - Simple flow charts or process diagrams to illustrate systems or workflows

2. **What not to show:**
   - Dense tables with lots of numbers
   - Complex multi-variable graphs
   - Detailed technical specifications or code snippets
   - Visualizations that require close inspection to understand
   - Animations or transitions that distract from the data
   - Too many data points or metrics in a single visual
   - Too much text

3. **Technologies to use:**
   - Matplotlib or Seaborn for creating static charts and graphs
   - Plotly for simple interactive elements that can be controlled during the presentation
   - Adobe Illustrator or Figma for creating custom infographics
   - Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides for final presentation assembly
   - Jupyter Notebooks for live data manipulation demonstrations

4. **Explanations:**
   - Prepare clear, concise talking points for each visualization
   - Use analogies or real-world examples to explain complex concepts
   - Provide context for why each piece of data matters to the audience
   - Be prepared to give more detailed explanations if asked
   - Use storytelling techniques to connect different data points into a coherent narrative
   - Include a clear "call to action" or key takeaways at the end of the presentation
