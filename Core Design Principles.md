# Core Design Principles

Data visualization transforms complex datasets into clear, compelling visual stories. It's a powerful tool that can reveal patterns or insights and make abstract concepts tangible.

By following fundamental design concepts, you can create visualizations that are not only visually appealing but also functional and impactful. In this section, the guide exlores the core design principles that form the foundation of effective data visualization. 

## Why Design Matters

Design in data visualization:

## General Rules

1. Arrange your visualization to show key points clearly.
2. Focus on making your message clear and simple.
3. Design for your audience's needs and knowledge.

6. Use the same styles and formats in all parts of your visualization.
7. Make sure people with different visual abilities can understand your visualization.
