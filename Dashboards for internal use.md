## Dashboards for internal use

Remember to keep the design simple and intuitive, allowing users to quickly grasp key information at a glance while providing the option to delve deeper into the data as needed. The more complex visualizations and statistical information should be presented in a way that doesn't overwhelm less technical users but still provides value to those who understand and need this level of detail. Don't focus too much on aesthetics.

### Audience characteristics
In this scenario, internal dashboards are typically designed for:
- Technical writers and content creators
- Documentation managers and team leads
- Developers and product managers who collaborate with the documentation team
- Stakeholders interested in documentation metrics and performance

This audience generally has:
- Familiarity with software development processes and documentation workflows
- Good technical literacy, including understanding of software metrics
- A need for insights into documentation progress, quality, and impact
- Regular interaction with the dashboard as part of their workflow

### General guidelines
1. Prioritize clarity and ease of use over aesthetic appeal
2. Use consistent layouts and color schemes across different dashboard sections
3. Implement interactivity for drill-down capabilities
4. Include clear labels and brief explanations where necessary
5. Ensure real-time or near-real-time data updates

### Example approach

For a software house's documentation team dashboard:

1. **What to show:**
   - Complex visualizations like heatmaps for document revision frequency
   - Box plots showing distribution of time spent on different documentation tasks
   - Confidence intervals for estimated project completion times
   - Correlation matrices for various documentation quality metrics
   - Statistical significance indicators for A/B tests on documentation improvements
   - Time series forecasts for upcoming workload based on historical data

2. **What not to show:**
   - Elaborate infographics that prioritize design over data clarity
   - Animated visualizations that may distract from the core information
   - Highly technical statistical outputs (e.g., full regression results) without context
   - Visualizations that require extensive domain knowledge to interpret
   - Complicated chart types like radar charts or bubble charts that may confuse users

3. **Technologies to use:**
   - Plotly for interactive charts and graphs
   - Dash (built on Plotly) for creating the dashboard interface
   - Pandas for data manipulation and preparation

4. **Explanations:**
   - Provide tooltips for quick explanations of statistical concepts (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals)
   - Include a brief legend or key for any color coding or symbols used
   - Add a short "How to use this dashboard" section for new users
   - Offer expandable sections with more detailed statistical explanations for interested users
